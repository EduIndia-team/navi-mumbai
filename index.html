CIDCO prepared a developmental plan for Navi Mumbai covering 95 villages all over the city.<br>For the first ten years of the project CIDCO acted as the planning and administrative body and as the developer and builder for the project. Taxes on property, land, commercial and water were payable to CIDCO.<br>CIDCO planned 14 nodes divided into the North and the South part. The 7 nodes in the North part are Airoli node, Ghansoli node, Kopar Khairane node, Vashi node, Sanpada node, Nerul node and Belapur node. The 7 nodes in the South part are Kharghar node, Kamothe node, Kalamboli, Pushpak node, Panvel node, Ulwe node and Dronagiri node. Also, two municipal bodies have been established, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) in the North and Panvel Municipal Corporation in the South.Each of the nodes is divided into smaller groups called sectors.<br>Initially only Juhu Vashi, Nerul and CBD Belapur were developed by CIDCO with housing, schools and community centre roads. But after the arrival of the harbour railway line extension in the 1990s, there was an increase in population. CIDCO shifted its development plan to nodes like Kharghar, Kamothe, New Panvel and Kopar Khairane. In its new development plan, CIDCO land was allocated to builders for housing. CIDCO only provided basic infrastructure like roads, water and electricity, these nodes were developed mostly by private builders according to the CIDCO plan.<br>The newly developed nodes of Navi Mumbai on the south side like Kharghar, Kamothe, New Panvel and Kalamboli are maintained by CIDCO. These nodes, which are all beyond CBD Belapur, come under the Raigad district.&nbsp;</p><ul class="list-inline banner-social-buttons"><li class="list-inline-item">&nbsp;<button class="btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-default" type="button"><i class="fa fa-google-plus fa-fw"></i><span class="network-name">&nbsp; Google+</span></button></li><li class="list-inline-item">&nbsp;<button class="btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-default" type="button"><i class="fa fa-twitter fa-fw"></i><span class="network-name">&nbsp;Twitter</span></button></li><li class="list-inline-item">&nbsp;<button class="btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-default" type="button"><i class="fa fa-github fa-fw"></i><span class="network-name">&nbsp;github</span></button></li></ul></div></div></div></section><div class="map-clean"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://cdn.bootstrapstudio.io/placeholders/map.html" width="100%" height="450"></iframe></div><footer><div class="container text-center"><p>Copyright Â©&nbsp;Brand 2021</p></div></footer><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script><script src="assets/js/script.min.js"></script></body></html>
